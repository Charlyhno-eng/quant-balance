# quant-balance

## Overview

![Overview main page](public/overview.png)

This application helps users **balance their crypto wallet** based on the **level of risk they are willing to take**. It provides a dashboard to visualize the current allocation, token metrics, and detailed risk indicators.

### Key Features

* Fetches real-time data for multiple cryptocurrencies using **CCXT**, a unified cryptocurrency trading library.
* Displays detailed metrics such as:
  * Token holdings
  * Price and total value
  * Risk score (from 1 to 10)
  * RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicators
  * Historical performance (1d, 7d, 30d, etc.)
  * Volatility
* Uses color-coded indicators to help quickly assess asset health (green = safer, red = riskier).
* Allows users to **rebalance** their portfolio dynamically according to calculated risks and allocations.
* Automatically refreshes data every 60 seconds for live updates.

### Technologies

* **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for the frontend
* **Material UI (MUI)** for the UI components
* **CCXT** for connecting to crypto exchanges and fetching market data
* Backend server (Python-based) to expose a REST API for crypto data

## Backend Python

The backend of this application is developed in Python to leverage a mature and powerful ecosystem of libraries dedicated to technical analysis and financial data processing.

### Why Python for the backend?

* **Specialized libraries**: Python offers robust and easy-to-use libraries such as **pandas** for data manipulation, **ta** for technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.), and **numpy** for numerical computations.
* **Simplified technical indicator calculations**: Computing complex indicators like RSI across multiple timeframes, volatility, and historical performance is more straightforward and efficient in Python compared to JavaScript.
* **Integration of the Fear and Greed Index**: The backend also fetches external sentiment data, such as the Fear and Greed Index, a key market sentiment indicator that enriches the overall risk score calculation.
* **Dedicated REST API**: The backend exposes all computed data through a REST API, allowing the Next.js frontend to stay lightweight and focused on the user interface.

This architecture cleanly separates complex technical computations from presentation, ensuring a more performant, maintainable, and scalable application.

### How the risk score is calculated

Here is a simple equation summarizing your risk calculation:

Risk Score = 10 × clamp(
  0.35 × (volatility / 2 + 0.35 × fearAndGreedNor + 0.08 × scaleRSI(rsi_1h + 0.09 × scaleRSI(rsi_4h + 0.10 × scaleRSI(rsi_1d + 0.10 × scalePerf(perf_1d, 20 + 0.05 × (perf_7d, 50 0.05 × scalePerf(perf_30d, 100 + 0.05 × scalePerf(perf_90d, 100 + 0.05 × scalePerf(perf_120d, 100), 1, 1
)

where:

* $\text{clamp}(x,a,b) = \min(b, \max(a,x))$,
* $\text{scaleRSI}(r) = 0.01 + 0.98 \times \text{clamp}\left(\frac{r-30}{60},0,1\right)$,
* $\text{scalePerf}(p,s) = \text{clamp}\left(\frac{|p|}{s},0,1\right)$.

signification of the parameters:

* **clamp(x, a, b)**: restricts the value `x` to stay within the range `[a, b]`. For example, clamp(1.2, 0, 1) = 1.
* **scaleRSI(r)**: transforms an RSI (Relative Strength Index) value between 30 and 90 into a score between 0.01 and 0.99. Higher RSI gives a higher score.
* **scalePerf(p, s)**: converts a performance percentage `p` into a score between 0 and 1 by dividing by a scale `s` (like 20, 50, 100) and clamping the result.

This produces a risk score between 1 and 10.
